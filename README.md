## 📝 Writeup Structure

Each report follows a professional pentesting workflow:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Port scanning and service enumeration.
2. **Analysis:** Identification of vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
3. **Exploitation:** Gaining initial access to the system.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Steps taken to achieve `root` or `SYSTEM` access.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These documents are for **educational purposes only**. The goal is to document the learning process and serve as a guide for the community. I encourage you to attempt the challenges yourself before consulting the full solution.
